# Greenlight Grid

# Description:

"GreenlightGrid-AI-Microgrids is an innovative open-source project focused on developing AI-Powered Green Energy Microgrids. It combines cutting-edge technologies in artificial intelligence (AI) and the Internet of Things (IoT) to facilitate decentralized energy management. This repository hosts the code for a dynamic, user-friendly platform that allows individuals to seamlessly buy, store, and sell renewable energy, whether they are connected to the main grid or operating independently.

# Key Features:

AI-Driven Control System: Integration of AI algorithms for efficient energy distribution and storage management.
IoT Connectivity: Utilization of IoT for real-time energy monitoring and grid management.
Decentralized Energy Framework: Focus on microgrids for localized energy production and consumption.
User Engagement: Interactive web interface with a focus on simplifying energy-related concepts for the general public.
Renewable Energy Transactions: Enable users to engage in buying, storing, and selling renewable energy.
The repository includes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files for the web platform, showcasing a clean and responsive design. The project is perfect for developers interested in renewable energy, decentralized systems, and AI applications in the energy sector."

# Additional Notes:

The project is part of Greenlight Grid's initiative to democratize access to green energy technologies and promote sustainable practices.
Detailed documentation is provided for setting up and customizing the platform.
